# Interiors and Closures

> #### Definition: Interiors

> Let $(X, \mathcal T)$ be a topological space, and let $U \subseteq X$.

> The **interior** of $A$, denoted $A^\circ$ or $\mathrm{int} (A)$, in $(X, \mathcal T)$ is defined as the union of all open sets contained in $A$. Explicitly, $\mathrm{int}_X$ can be considered as a mapping from $\mathcal P(X)$ to $\mathcal P(X)$, which is defined as

Take Euclidean topological space $(\mathbb R^n, \mathcal T)$ for example. As $\mathcal T$ is generated by the collection $\mathcal O$ of all open balls in the space, any open ball $B(x, \delta)$ is open. So,
